ExtEdit
=======

ExtEdit is a Thunderbird/Icedove extension to allow editing an email in an
external editor.  It is based on
http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&pg=2[Alexandre Feblot's External Editor
extension].

This extension is in a very preliminary state, and has been updated just enough
to get it working in modern versions of Thunderbird.  Pull requests are welcome.

To build, simply type `make`.  You can then install it in Thunderbird.
