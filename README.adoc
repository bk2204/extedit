ExtEdit
=======

ExtEdit is a Thunderbird/Icedove extension to allow editing an email in an
external editor, such as Vim or Emacs.  It is based on
http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&pg=2[Alexandre Feblot's External Editor
extension].

This extension is in a very preliminary state, and has been updated just enough
to get it working in modern versions of Thunderbird.  Further work will aim to
improve the codebase and add new features.

To build, simply type `make`.  You can then install the XPI in Thunderbird.

Pull requests are welcome.  The standard is to use hard tabs, aligned at four
spaces.  The current codebase is moving in that direction, even if it isn't
there yet.
